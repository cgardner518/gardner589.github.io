    <p>EXT. GALAXY - PLANET HOTH

A Star Destroyer moves through space, releasing Imperial probe robots
from its underside.

One of these probes zooms toward the planet Hoth and lands on its ice-
covered surface.  An explosion marks the point of
impact.

EXT. HOTH - METEORITE CRATER - SNOW PLAIN - DAY

A weird mechanical sound rises above the whining of the wind.  A
strange probe robot, with several extended sensors, emerges from the
smoke-shrouded crater.  The ominous mechanical probe floats across the
snow plain and disappears into the distance.

EXT. PLAIN OF HOTH - DAY

A small figure gallops across the windswept ice slope.  The bundled
rider is mounted on a large gray snow lizard, a Tauntaun.  Curving
plumes of snow rise from beneath the speeding paws of the two-legged
beast.

The rider gallops up a slope and reins his lizard to a stop.  Pulling
off his protective goggles, Luke Skywalker notices something in the
sky.  He takes a pair of electrobinoculars from his utility belt and
through them sees smoke rising from where the probe robot has crashed.

The wind whips at Luke's fur-lined cap and he activates a comlink
transmitter.  His Tauntaun shifts and moans nervously beneath him.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Echo Three to Echo Seven.  Han,
		old buddy, do you read me?

After a little static a familiar voice is heard.

				HAN
			(over comlink)
		Loud and clear, kid.  What's up?

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Well, I finished my circle.  I
		don't pick up any life readings.

				HAN
			(over comlink)
		There isn't enough life on this
		ice cube to fill a space cruiser.
		The sensors are placed, I'm going
		back.

				LUKE
			(into comlink)
		Right.  I'll see you shortly.
		There's a meteorite that hit the
		ground near here.  I want to check
		it out.  It won't take long.

Luke clicks off his transmitter and reins back on his nervous lizard.
He pats the beast on the head to calm it.

				LUKE
		Hey, steady girl.  What's the
		matter?  You smell something?

Luke takes a small device from his belt and starts to adjust it when
suddenly a large shadow falls over him from behind.  He hears a
monstrous howl and turns to see an eleven-foot-tall shape towering over
him.  It is a Wampa Ice Creature, lunging at him ferociously.

				LUKE
		Aaargh!

Luke grabs for his pistol, but is hit flat in the face by a huge white
claw.  He falls unconscious into the snow and in a moment the terrified
screams of the Tauntaun are cut short by the horrible snap of a neck
being broken.

The Wampa Ice Creature grabs Luke by one ankle and drags him away
across the frozen plain.

EXT. HOTH - REBEL BASE ENTRANCE - DAY

A stalwart figure rides his Tauntaun up to the entrance of an enormous
ice cave.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

Rebel troopers rush about unloading supplies and otherwise securing
their new base.  The rider, Han Solo, swings off his lizard and pulls
off his goggles.

He walks into the main hangar deck toward the Millennium Falcon, which
is parked among several fighters.  Mechanics, R2 units, and various
other droids hurry about.  Han stops at the Millennium Falcon where his
Wookiee copilot, Chewbacca, is welding on a central lifter.  Chewie
stops his work and lifts his face shield, growling an irritated
greeting to his boss.

				HAN
		Chewie!

The Wookiee grumbles a reply.

				HAN
		All right, don't lose your temper.
		I'll come right back and give you
		a hand.

Chewbacca puts his mask back on and returns to his welding as Han
leaves.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - COMMAND CENTER

A makeshift command center has been set up in a blasted area of thick
ice.  The low-ceilinged room is a beehive of activity. Controllers,
troops, and droids move about setting up electronic equipment and
monitoring radar signals.

General Rieekan straightens up from a console at Han's approach.

				RIEEKAN
		Solo?

				HAN
No sign of life out there, General.
The sensors are in place.  You'll
know if anything comes around.

				RIEEKAN
		Commander Skywalker reported in yet?

				HAN
		No.  He's checking out a meteorite
		that hit near him.

				RIEEKAN
			(indicates radar
			 screen)
		With all the meteor activity in this
		system, it's going to be difficult
		to spot approaching ships.

Taking a deep breath, Han blurts out what is on his mind.

				HAN
		General, I've got to leave.  I
		can't stay anymore.

Princess Leia, standing at a console nearby, is dressed in a short
white combat jacket and pants.  Her hair is braided across her head in
a Nordic fashion.  She overhears their  conversation and seems somewhat
distressed.

				RIEEKAN
		I'm sorry to hear that.

				HAN
		Well, there's a price on my head.
		If I don't pay off Jabba the Hut,
		I'm a dead man.

				RIEEKAN
		A death mark's not an easy thing
		to live with.  You're a good
		fighter, Solo.  I hate to lose you.

				HAN
		Thank you, General.

He turns to Leia as Rieekan moves away.

				HAN
			(with feeling)
		Well, Your Highness, I guess this
		is it.

				LEIA
		That's right.

Leia is angry.  Han sees she has no warmth to offer him.  He shakes his
head and adopts a sarcastic tone.

				HAN
			(cooly)
		Well, don't get all mushy on me.
		So long, Princess.

Han walks away into the quiet corridor adjoining the command center.
Leia stews a moment, then hurries after him.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ICE CORRIDOR

				LEIA
		Han!

Han stops in the corridor and turns to face Leia.

				HAN
		Yes, Your Highnessness?

				LEIA
		I thought you decided to stay.

				HAN
		Well, the bounty hunter we ran
		into on Ord Mantell changed my
		mind.

				LEIA
		Han, we need you!

				HAN
		We?

				LEIA
		Yes.

				HAN
		Oh, what about you need?

				LEIA
			(mystified)
		I need?  I don't know what you're
		talking about.

				HAN
			(shakes his head,
			 fed up)
		You probably don't.

				LEIA
		And what precisely am I supposed
		to know?

				HAN
		Come on!  You want me to stay
		because of the way you feel about
		me.

				LEIA
		Yes.  You're a great help to us.
		You're a natural leader...

				HAN
		No!  That's not it.  Come on.
		Aahhh - uh huh!  Come on.

Leia stares at him, understanding, then laughs.

				LEIA
You're imagining things.

				HAN
		Am I?  Then why are you following
		me?  Afraid I was going to leave
		without giving you a goodbye kiss?

				LEIA
		I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.

				HAN
		I can arrange that.  You could use
		a good kiss!

Angrily, Han strides down the corridor as Leia stares after him.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - ANOTHER ICE CORRIDOR

A familiar stream of beeps and whistles herald the approach of Artoo-
Detoo and See-Threepio, who appear around a corner and move along an
ice wall toward the main hangar.

				THREEPIO
		Don't try to blame me.  I didn't
		ask you to turn on the thermal
		heater.  I merely commented that it
		was freezing in the princess'
		chamber.  But it's supposed to be
		freezing.  How are we going to dry
		out all her clothes?  I really don't
		know.

Artoo beeps a stream of protesting whistles.

				THREEPIO
		Oh, switch off.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK

The two robots stop at Han Solo's space freighter.  Han and Chewie are
struggling with their central lifters.

				HAN
			(to Chewie)
		Why do you take this apart now?
		I'm trying to get us out of here
		and you pull both of these.

Chewie grumbles in irritation.

				THREEPIO
		Excuse me, sir.

				HAN
			(to Chewie)
		Put them back together right now.

				THREEPIO
		Might I have a word with you,
		please?

				HAN
		What do you want?

				THREEPIO
		Well, it's Princess Leia, sir.
		She's been trying to get you on
		the communicator.

				HAN
		I turned it off.  I don't want to
		talk to her.

				THREEPIO
		Oh.  Well, Princess Leia is wondering
		about Master Luke.  He hasn't come
		back yet.  She doesn't know where he
		is.

				HAN
		I don't know where he is.

				THREEPIO
		Nobody knows where he is.

				HAN
		What do you mean, "nobody knows"?

Han glances at the fading light at the entrance of the ice cave as
night slowly begins to fall on the planet.

				THREEPIO
		Well, uh, you see...

Han jumps down off the lift, as Threepio follows him.

				HAN
		Deck Officer.  Deck Officer!

				THREEPIO
		Excuse me, sir.  Might I inqu...

Han abruptly puts his hand over Threepio's mouth as the deck officer
approaches.

				DECK OFFICER
		Yes, sir?

				HAN
		Do you know where Commander
		Skywalker is?

				DECK OFFICER
		I haven't seen him.  It's possible
		he came in through the south entrance.

				HAN
		It's possible?  Why don't you go
		find out?  It's getting dark out there.

				DECK OFFICER
		Yes, sir.

The deck officer leaves hurriedly, as Han takes his hand off Threepio's
mouth.

				THREEPIO
		Excuse me, sir.  Might I inquire
		what's going on?

				HAN
		Why not?

				THREEPIO
		Impossible man.  Come along, Artoo,
		let's find Princess Leia.  Between
		ourselves, I think Master Luke is
		in considerable danger.

INT. HOTH - REBEL BASE - MAIN ICE TUNNEL

The deck officer and his assistant hurry toward Han as he enters the
tunnel.

				DECK OFFICER
		Sir, Commander Skywalker hasn't
		come in through the south entrance.
		He might have forgotten to check in.

				HAN
		Not likely.  Are the speeders ready?

				DECK OFFICER
		Not yet.  We're having some trouble
		adapting them to the cold.

				HAN
		Then we'll have to go out on
		Tauntauns.

				DECK OFFICER
		Sir, the temperature's dropping too
		rapidly.

				HAN
		That's right.  And my friends out
		in it.

				ASSISTANT OFFICER
		I'll cover sector twelve.  Have
		com-control set screen alpha.

Han pushes through the troops and mounts a Tauntaun.

				DECK OFFICER
		Your Tauntaun'll freeze before you
		reach the first marker.

				HAN
		Then I'll see you in hell!

Han maneuvers his mount out of the cave and races into the dark bitter
night.

EXT. HOTH - ICE GORGE - DUSK

The jagged face of a huge ice wall sits gloomily in the dim twilight of
a Hoth day.  Luke hangs upside down, ankles frozen into icy
stalactites, his extended arms within a foot of the snow floor.  One
side of his face is covered in a dried mask of frozen blood.  He opens
his eyes as a chilling moan of the hideous ice creature echoes off the
gorge walls.  Luke pulls himself up, grabs hold of his ankles, and
futilely tries to unfasten the throngs.

Exhausted, he drops back into his hanging position.  As he hangs there,
he spies his lightsaber lying near a pile of his discarded gear, about
three feet out of reach.

He focuses on the saber and, as his hand strains toward the weapon, he
squeezes his eyes tight in concentration.

Just as the ice creature looms over Luke, the lightsaber jumps into
Luke's hand.

The young warrior instantly ignites his sword, swinging up, and cuts
himself loose from the ice.  He flops to the snow in a heap.  The
startled creature moves back, his giant yellow eyes blinking.  Luke
scrambles to his feet.  He swings his lightsaber and the beast screams
in pain.

EXT. HOTH - ENTRANCE TO ICE GORGE - DUSK

Luke staggers out of the gorge into the dark and snowy twilight.  Weak
and exhausted, he stumbles down a snow bank.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW PLAIN - DUSK

A small, lone figure riding a Tauntaun races through the hostile
vastness of snow and cold.  As it runs, the Tauntaun's legs kick up
large clouds of snow and ice into the snowy air.

EXT. HOTH - OUTSIDE ICE				 HANGAR - DUSK

Artoo stands in the falling snow, beeping worriedly.  Threepio moves
stiffly over to him.

				THREEPIO
		You must come along now, Artoo.
		There's really nothing more we can
		do.  And my joints are freezing up.

Artoo beeps, long and low.

				THREEPIO
		Don't say thing like that!  Of
		course we'll see Master Luke again.
		He'll be quite all right, you'll see.
			(to himself)
		Stupid little short-circuit.  He'll
		be quite all right.

Threepio turns to go back inside the main hangar as Artoo mournfully
keeps his vigil.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW DRIFT - DUSK

The wind is blowing quite strong now.  Luke struggles to stay upright,
but a blast of freezing snow knocks him over.  He struggles to get up,
but he can't.  The young warrior from Tatooine drags himself a couple
of feet and then collapses.

INT. REBEL BASE - MAIN HANGAR DECK - ENTRANCE - NIGHT

Princess Leia stands inside the dark entrance to the Rebel base,
waiting for a sign of the two Rebel heroes.  She shivers in the cold
wind as, nearby, Chewie sits with his head in his hands.  In the
background, Artoo and Threepio move through the doors.

A Rebel lieutenant moves to Major Derlin, an officer keeping watch with
the princess.

				LIEUTENANT
		Sir, all the patrols are in.
		There's still no contact from
		Skywalker or Solo.

				THREEPIO
		Mistress Leia, Artoo says he's been
		quite unable to pick up any signals,
		although he does admit that his own
		range is far too weak to abandon
		all hope.

Leia nods an acknowledgment, but she is lost in thought.

				DERLIN
		Your Highness, there's nothing
		more we can do tonight.  The shield
		doors must be closed.

He turns to the lieutenant.

				DERLIN
		Close the doors.

				LIEUTENANT
		Yes, sir.

The lieutenant walks away.  Chewie lets out a long, mournful howl,
somewhat like a coyote.  At the same moment, Artoo begins a complex
series of efficient beeps.

				THREEPIO
		Artoo says the chances of survival
		are seven hundred seventy-five...
		to one.

Leia stands praying to herself as the huge metal doors slam across the
entrance of the ice cave.  The loud booms echo throughout the huge
cavern.  Chewie lets out another suffering howl.

				THREEPIO
		Actually, Artoo has been known to
		make mistakes... from time to time.
		Oh, dear, oh, dear.  Don't worry
		about Master Luke.  I'm sure he'll
		be all right.  He's quite clever,
		you know... for a human being.

EXT. HOTH - SNOW DRIFT - DUSK

Luke lies face down in the snow, nearly unconscious.  Slowly he looks
up and sees Ben Kenobi, barely visible through the blowing snow.  It is
hard to tell if Kenobi is real or a hallucination.

				BEN
		Luke... Luke.

				LUKE
			(weakly)
		Ben?

				BEN
		You will go to the Dagobah system.

				LUKE
		Dagobah system?

				BEN
		There you will learn from Yoda,
		the Jedi Master who instructed me.

The image of Ben fades, revealing a lone Tauntaun rider approaching
from the windswept horizon.

				LUKE
			(groaning faintly)
		Ben... Ben.

Luke drops into unconsciousness.

Han pulls up and leaps off his mount.  He hurries to his snow-covered
friend, cradling him in his arms.  Han's Tauntaun lets out a low,
pitiful bellow.  But Han's concern is with Luke, and he shakes him
urgently.

				HAN
		Luke!  Luke!  Don't do this, Luke.
		Come on, give me a sign here.

Luke doesn't respond.  Han begins frantically rubbing and slapping
Luke's unconscious face.  As he starts to lift the youth, Han hears a
rasping sound behind him.  He turns, just in time to see his Tauntaun
stagger and then fall over into the snow.

Han carries Luke to the moaning beast.  Then, with a final groan, the
Tauntaun expires.

				HAN
		Not much time.

He pushes Luke's inert form against the belly of the dead beast.

				LUKE
			(moaning)
		Ben... Ben...

				HAN
		Hang on, kid.

				LUKE
		Dagobah system...

Han ignites Luke's saber and cuts the beast from head to toe.  He
quickly tosses it's steaming innards into the snow, then lifts Luke's
inert form and stuffs him inside the carcass.

				HAN
			(reeling from the
			 odor)
		Whew...

				LUKE
		Dagobah...

				HAN
		This may smell bad, kid...

				LUKE
			(moaning)
		Yoda...

				HAN
		...but it will keep you warm...
		til I get the shelter built.
			(struggling to get
			 Luke inside the
			 carcass)
		Ooh... I thought they smelled bad
		on the outside!

The wind has picked up considerably, making it difficult to move.  Han
removes a pack from the dead creature's back, taking out a shelter
container.  He begins to set up what can only be a pitiful protection
against a bitter Hoth night.
