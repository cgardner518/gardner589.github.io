    <p>The <code>Flexbox Layout</code> (Flexible Box) module (currently a W3C Last Call Working Draft) aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word "flex").</p>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Flexbox layout is most appropriate to the components of an application, and small-scale layouts, while the <a href="http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/">Grid</a> layout is intended for larger scale layouts.

      <p>Anakin Skywalker was a Force-sensitive human male who served the Galactic
        Republic as a Jedi Knight, and later the Galactic Empire as the
        Sith Lord Darth Vader. Believed to have been conceived by the Force,
        he was born to Shmi Skywalker into a life of slavery on the Outer Rim
        world of Tatooine. At a young age, Skywalker was discovered by the Jedi Order,
        who freed Anakin from slavery and brought the boy into their community;
        hailing Skywalker as the Chosen One of Jedi prophecy, destined to defeat
        the Sith and bring balance to the Force.</p>

    <p>The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items' width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space, or shrinks them to prevent overflow.</p>
    <p>Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based). While those work well for pages, they lack flexibility (no pun intended) to support large or complex applications (especially when it comes to orientation changing, resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.). </p>
